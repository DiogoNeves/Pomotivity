# README #

Pomotivity is a simple and fun productivity application that follows the **Pomodoro Technique**® guidelines.  

-----

I started the project to learn more about *Android Development*, but since then I'm onto it, why not creating something I could use?  

I wasn't happy having to remember and manually switch off notifications during my pomodoros.  
With **Pomotivity** that shouldn't be a problem.  
Also, for the geeks out there, it integrates with *IFTTT* in case you need something more flexible.

Feel free to help ;)

* Code review
